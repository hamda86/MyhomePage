  <h2 id="about_me"> About me </h2>
  
  <p> I want to become a software developer because I want to meet like minded people, who enjoy solving problems. I often solve puzzles in my spare time because I love the feeling of 'cracking a code'. To be able to replicate that feeling through programming. Truthfully is what excites me about having a career in tech and why I have decided to. <br>
Despite,  Electronics and ICT being one of my favourite classes in high school growing up. I went on to study Film & Television at university. Now it is at this point time in my life, that I am facing my biggest challenge yet. Trying to pave a new path for myself but I don't feel scared. This is because learning to code these past weeks has made me happy. So every roadblock is just another chance for me to learn something new. I welcome that at every turn because I am inquisitive by nature and enjoy testing my capabilities.</p>

   <p> My two loves in this world are gardening and rollerskating, here's why? I like to spend my free time in my garden, it is my oasis. It is where I connect with mother nature, after indulging in the city for too long. 
The therapeutic act of looking after another life brings me joy. It reminds me to be in touch with my life. When I feel down, gardening allows me to recollect my thoughts and realise that I should be optimistic instead.I am a calm person and that is thanks partly to my gardening hobby.<br>When I rollerskate I spend most of my time on my bum than anything. But the thrill of learning something new keeps me going. When I learn a new trick it's the best feeling in the world. It is in those small moments. That I get the chance to unwind from my thoughts and be in the moment.  It is only then, do my troubles feel so far away.<br> One of life's pleasures is losing track of time when you’re having fun. I feel this when I solve a puzzle, code, rollerskate and garden.This is a feeling I want to continue to chase, so I won't be dropping it any time soon.
